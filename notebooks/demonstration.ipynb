The United Kingdom remained the first country in the world to agree to a military resolution that took effect in 1931 to eliminate civilian casualties. Nevertheless, the General Election on September 30, 1932 left the government of Britain with only one remaining military force, and the British government began negotiations with France to increase its military force in January 1933 after a two-way drawup. In order to resolve this conflict, Britain sent a navy force to assist the German and Italian battalions and was to move troops and ammunition to Germany and Italy. By September 1933, they had already reached agreement on how to increase their support for the Second World War.
